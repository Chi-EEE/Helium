# Helium

Based on Rocrastinate.

## Building

If you want to build the project and you have LuaJIT installed, you can use the following command in the root directory. Note that this still requires Rojo to build: `luajit Build.lua`

If you don't have LuaJIT installed, you can use the following command in the root directory. This again, still requires Rojo. `rojo build -o Helium.rbxm build.project.json`
